        <p>Adaptive Community-Assisted Infrastructure, also known as A&ccedil;a&iacute;, is a forum project dedicated to bridging gaps between communities, both socially and physically, by bringing to attention places of poor development. This website intends to give the community a voice that can operate without the intervention of other forces, one that can be taken up as a commission by any willing benefactor, and can track the changes in real-time in accordance with the needs and wants of the community throughout the process. </p>
